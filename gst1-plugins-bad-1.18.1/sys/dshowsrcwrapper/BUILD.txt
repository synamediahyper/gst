== Dependencies ==

 * CMake (tested with 3.9, likely >=3.0 will work)

 * GStreamer (1.8 or newer)

 * Microsoft SDK
   (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279). Don't
   use any after 7.1, they don't include the samples. You can uncheck
   the .NET stuff.

 * Visual Studio, in theory any version will do; tested with 2013
   Express
   (http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx).

== Build ==

First build the SDK "baseclasses" sample; they should have been
installed in <SDK>/Samples/multimedia/directshow/baseclasses. Just
open the SLN and build both Debug_MBCS and Release_MBCS.

If you get a build error "ctype.h: no such file or directory", try
retargetting the solution from the Project menu.

Then go to sys/dshowsrcwrapper and use CMake to generate the project
file for your chosen version of Visual Studio. There are two influential
variables:

 * GST_INSTALL_BASE: your GStreamer installation directory
   (default C:\gstreamer\1.0\x86 or C:\gstreamer\1.0\x86_64)

 * SDK_INSTALL_BASE: the Windows SDK installation path (default
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0).

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" ..

Open the SLN and build the project. Copy the DLL to the GStreamer
plugins directory.
